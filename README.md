# Ti-fuzz: Fuzz TiDB!

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Install deps
    ```shell
    # mysqld is required, version >= 8
    apt install mysql-server
    ```
2. Get source trees
    ```shell
    # To allow `go get` to access private repos
    # WARNING: access permission to PingCAP-QE is required
    go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/pragmatwice/go-squirrel
    git config --global url.git@github.com:.insteadOf https://github.com/
    # Clone modified TiDB that supports fuzzing
    git clone git@github.com:oraluben/tidb.git
    # Clone Ti Fuzz
    git clone git@github.com:oraluben/go-fuzz.git
    ```

### Build

1. Build Ti Fuzz tools
`cd <oraluben/go-fuzz>`
`go build ./go-fuzz-build -o ti-fuzz-build`
`go build ./go-fuzz -o ti-fuzz-main`
1. Build the instrumented TiDB 
`cd <oraluben/tidb>/tidb-server/fuzz`
`ti-fuzz-build -o tidb-fuzz.zip`

### Config
There are two sql files required for fuzzing TiDB:
1. Initial SQL file: [(example)](https://github.com/oraluben/go-fuzz/blob/ti-fuzz/ti-fuzz/example.init.sql)
This SQL file is used to initialize the fuzzing, so it is the first seed of the mutation procedure. Usually, it is composed of some DDLs such as `CREATE TABLE` followed by some DMLs like `INSERT`, and the last statement of this file must be a `SELECT` or set operation statement, i.e. `UNION`. 
(Because the only supported statement to mutate is select or set operation statements until now, and `WITH` clauses is also supported)
2. Mutation Library SQL file: [(example)](https://github.com/oraluben/go-fuzz/blob/ti-fuzz/ti-fuzz/example.lib.sql)
This SQL file is used to control what can be mutate to: all nodes of statements in the file can be selected to replace existing nodes in seeds.

More examples can be found in every test directory of [ti-fuzz-corpus](https://github.com/PingCAP-QE/ti-fuzz-corpus).

### Run
```
Usage of ti-fuzz-main:
  -bin string
        test binary built with go-fuzz-build
  -connectiontimeout duration
        time limit for worker to try to connect coordinator (default 1m0s)
  -coordinator string
        coordinator mode (value is coordinator address)
  -covercounters
        use coverage hit counters (default true)
  -dumpcover
        dump coverage profile into workdir
  -dup
        collect duplicate crashers
  -func string
        function to fuzz
  -http string
        HTTP server listen address (coordinator mode only)
  -init-path string
        initial SQL file path, include ddl (create) and dml (insert, select) to initialize seed
  -lib-path string
        library SQL file path, include select statement to be mutated to
  -minimize duration
        time limit for input minimization (default 1m0s)
  -procs int
        parallelism level (default 1)
  -rm
        remove TiDB and MySQL data dir after shutdown instance
  -sonar
        use sonar hints
  -timeout int
        test timeout, in seconds (default 10)
  -v int
        verbosity level
  -workdir string
        dir with persistent work data (default ".")
  -worker string
        worker mode (value is coordinator address)
```
For basic usage, you can type `ti-fuzz-main -init-path init.sql -lib-path lib.sql -rm -bin tidb-fuzz.zip`, with the instrumented TiDB generated by `ti-fuzz-build`, the initial sql and the mutation library sql file in the current directory.

Once started, `ti-fuzz-main` will firstly create a TiDB instance and a MySQL instance, then execute the initial SQL for both instances. And next, it will mutate the select statement to another statement with coverage guided, compare select results of both instances and report the different results.

The execution will never stop except SIGINT or other signal is sent to the process of Ti Fuzz. Generally, 12 hours are suitable for most cases.

### Analyze results
Some directories will be generated during execution of Ti Fuzz:
- `corpus`: a.k.a. seeds (one per file) generated by Ti Fuzz
- `crashers`: generated while TiDB crashes or query results between TiDB and MySQL are different
    - `<hash>`: the input SQL of this crasher.
    - `<hash>.output`: the output (panic message of TiDB) of this crasher
- `suppressions`: for filtering same errors

There are several types of the result reported by Ti Fuzz (can be found in `crashers/*.output`):
- Both Error: Both TiDB and MySQL give an error message for a same input, but these errors are not same.
`panic: [both err] tidb: ..., mysql: ...`
- One Side Error: Either TiDB or MySQL give an error message, another instance give the result (not error).
`panic: [one side err] tidb: ..., mysql: ...`
- Metainfo Difference: Both TiDB and MySQL give a non-error result, but the column types (`n=1`), column name (`n=2`), number of rows (`n=3`) or number of columns (`n=4`) of both results has some difference.
`panic: [metainfo diff (n)] tidb: ..., mysql: ...`
- Data Difference: Both TiDB and MySQL give a non-error result and there is no metainfo difference, but there are some difference on specific values in the results.
`panic: [data diff]: tidb: ..., mysql: ...`

The SQL statements generated by Ti Fuzz can be complex, containing many subqueries and join clauses, you can use [our reduce tool](https://github.com/PingCAP-QE/go-squirrel) to simplify these statements for reproducing or analyzing root causes.

### Dump coverage & Visualization

`go-fuzz ... -dumpcover` will generate `coverprofile`
`go tool cover -html=coverprofile`

Note: `go-fuzz` will not always generate valid coverage file for `go tool cover`, you might
need `sed -i"" -e '/0.0,1.1/d' coverprofile` (MacOS) or `sed -i '/0.0,1.1/d' coverprofile` (Linux) before generating
HTML coverage report.

### Q&A
1. How to run faster?
You can use multiple process mode by `-procs N`, where `N` is the number of processes
